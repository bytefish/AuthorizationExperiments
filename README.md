# Exploring Relationship-based Access Control with Google Zanzibar #

I have recently read about a paper on Google Zanzibar, which is Google's 
solution for providing authorization among its many services:

In this repository we will take a look at the data model of Google Zanzibar and play 
around with some data. It's not meant to be a production-ready implementation, but 
to show some SQL and play with ideas.

All code can be found in a GitHub repository at:
